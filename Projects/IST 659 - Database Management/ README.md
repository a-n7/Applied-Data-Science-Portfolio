## Description
The project entails developing a comprehensive database solution for Precise Management Production, a production management company facing challenges in managing their movie production data efficiently due to exponential growth. The current reliance on Excel spreadsheets leads to clerical errors, data inconsistencies, and poor version control. The aim is to create a robust database system that enables users to search for movie data, actors, directors, movie performance, and casting by year, addressing the needs of stakeholders including production companies, movie casters, budget departments, directors, and actors.

Key objectives include facilitating informed decision-making in casting, location selection, and genre performance analysis based on revenue and ratings. The database will enable queries such as identifying the highest and lowest-rated movies, their directors, main actors, profitability, budget adherence, filming location cost analysis, director and actor filmography, and instances of actors directing movies. By adhering to the database lifecycle, from scoping the project to implementing conceptual and logical models into a functional database, the project ensures data integrity, accessibility, and usability for informed business insights.

Further optimization opportunities involve expanding the database structure by incorporating additional entities or attributes to enhance usability over time. Leveraging tools like Microsoft Excel and Tableau for visualization aids in presenting findings effectively. Ultimately, the developed database promises to empower production companies to streamline operations, maximize profits, and make informed decisions in a dynamic film industry landscape.
