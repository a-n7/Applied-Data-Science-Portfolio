## Project Overview:

A bank is conducting detailed analysis using demographic data to identify factors leading to customer churn in their credit card services. By employing various visualization and machine learning techniques, the analysis aims to provide proactive recommendations to retain existing customers, develop new products, and address the underlying reasons for customer attrition. The findings will guide the bank's marketing team in crafting personalized recommendations and enhancing overall product and service offerings to meet the evolving needs of customers.

### Methods Used:

The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM (Linear and Radial), and kNN, to build predictive models for customer churn. The accuracy of each model is compared, with Random Forest demonstrating the highest accuracy. Important variables influencing churn, such as transaction count, transaction amount, contacts, and revolving balances, are identified, aligning with APRIORI rules.
