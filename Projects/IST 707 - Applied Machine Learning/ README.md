## Project Overview:

The "Bank Churners" project conducted as part of the IST 707 Applied Machine Learning course by Renjini Rajan and Amanda Norwood aims to analyze factors influencing customer churn in the banking industry. Focusing on current and past credit card customers, the dataset contains demographic information along with banking and credit card behavior.

### Methods Used:

The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM (Linear and Radial), and kNN, to build predictive models for customer churn. The accuracy of each model is compared, with Random Forest demonstrating the highest accuracy. Important variables influencing churn, such as transaction count, transaction amount, contacts, and revolving balances, are identified, aligning with APRIORI rules.
