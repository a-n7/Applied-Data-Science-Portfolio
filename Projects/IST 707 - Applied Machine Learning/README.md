## Description
The project focuses on analyzing customer attrition within a bank's credit card services, leveraging demographic and transactional data to understand underlying reasons for customer churn. By delving into customer behaviors and spending trends, the study aims to provide insights for proactive retention strategies. Through various analytical models, including visualization and machine learning techniques, the analysis identifies critical data points such as transaction count, revolving balance, and customer contacts, which serve as indicators of potential churn.

Among the models utilized, Random Forest emerges as the most effective, offering recommendations for the bank's marketing team to monitor key metrics closely and initiate customer check-ins upon detecting declining trends. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of incentivizing new customers and expanding rewards programs to enhance customer retention. Banking analytics further enable the identification of top merchants, allowing for tailored rewards programs aligned with customer spending habits, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience and driving revenue growth.

The project underscores the need for ongoing analysis, considering factors beyond internal data, such as external economic conditions and customer credit scores. Communication and customer feedback play integral roles in ensuring satisfaction, while remaining vigilant about market dynamics and competitors' offerings is crucial for maintaining competitiveness. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the iterative nature of customer retention strategies, requiring continuous evaluation and adaptation to meet evolving customer needs and market trends.
