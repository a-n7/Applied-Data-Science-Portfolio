## Project Overview

The analysis delves into factors affecting housing affordability in Los Angeles, primarily examining gender, degree, and profession impacts. Key methods include linear regression for salary forecasting, t-tests to uncover gender pay gaps, and machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Naïve Bayes for predicting housing affordability based on profession.

### Methods Utilized:
- Linear Regression: Predicted salary values for 2021-2023 and analyzed wage variability based on gender and degree type.
- T-Tests: Revealed significant pay differences between genders across various education levels, except for bachelor's degrees.
- Random Forest: Employed decision trees to predict housing affordability based on profession, achieving 100% accuracy.
- Naïve Bayes: Utilized probability algorithms to predict housing affordability with a 94.84% accuracy rate.
These methods provide insights into gender pay disparities, income potential based on profession, and aid in decision-making regarding housing affordability and career choices in Los Angeles.
