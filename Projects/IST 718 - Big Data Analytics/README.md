## Description

The analysis highlights significant disparities in housing affordability and earnings based on gender, degree, and profession in Los Angeles. Men consistently out earn women across various degree types and professions, with only two professions offering the possibility of affording a home on a single salary. Notably, the analysis reveals a correlation between affordable housing and higher crime rates, suggesting potential trade-offs between affordability and safety.

Recommendations emphasize the importance of researching pay based on profession before migrating to Los Angeles, particularly considering potential gender disparities in salary. Negotiating fair compensation is advised for all individuals, regardless of gender. Furthermore, individuals should consider reported average wages for their chosen profession, informing career decisions and potential adjustments such as further education or career changes.

Given the housing affordability challenges, living with roommates is suggested as a strategy to mitigate costs and enhance security. By sharing expenses and responsibilities, individuals can navigate affordability challenges while prioritizing safety. Overall, the analysis aims to equip potential migrants with essential information to make informed decisions regarding housing affordability and salary prospects in Los Angeles.
