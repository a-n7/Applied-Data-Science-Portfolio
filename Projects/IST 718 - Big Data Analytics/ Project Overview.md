## Project Overview

The City of Los Angeles is spearheading a project to aid migrants in their relocation by developing a tool that delves into the correlation between crime rates and housing affordability. This initiative aims to investigate the influence of demographics and education on income levels and housing costs, pinpointing key factors driving home prices in different areas.

### Methods Utilized:
- Linear Regression: Predicted salary values for 2021-2023 and analyzed wage variability based on gender and degree type.
- T-Tests: Revealed significant pay differences between genders across various education levels, except for bachelor's degrees.
- Random Forest: Employed decision trees to predict housing affordability based on profession, achieving 100% accuracy.
- Na√Øve Bayes: Utilized probability algorithms to predict housing affordability with a 94.84% accuracy rate.
These methods provide insights into gender pay disparities, income potential based on profession, and aid in decision-making regarding housing affordability and career choices in Los Angeles.
